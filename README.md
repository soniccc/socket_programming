# socket_programming

This repo is really just for me to develop small apps using the python library. 

client_server_app
This is a simple first attempt is setting up a client to connect to a server and receive a message from the server.
The files client_macos.py and server_macos.py are specifically for MacOS. The client.py and server.py can be run on Linux. 
I can't remember why they had to be different, when I do I'll update this README!

There is also a Dockerfile where you can run the server in a container. 

chat_app
This is an attempt to create a chat application. This nearly works as I want to but I need to do some tweaks on it.
